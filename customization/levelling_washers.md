## A "poor man's kinematic mount"

* 25mm-30mm screw/bolt
* M3 washer
* Rubber washer (small)
* Bed
* M6 or [1/4" levelling washers](https://www.mcmaster.com/94007a030) (also known as [spherical](https://www.accu.co.uk/en/spherical-washers/410975-HSSPW-M6-A2) & [spherical seat washers](https://www.accu.co.uk/en/spherical-seat-washers/409767-HCSW-M6-A2) - they are two pieces)
* Z-yoke
* Rubber washer(small)
* M3 washer
* Nyloc nut

The M3 washer at the top and bottom is so the bolt doesn't pull through the rubber washers
